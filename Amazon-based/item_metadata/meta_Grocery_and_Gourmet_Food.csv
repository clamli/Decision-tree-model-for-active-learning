3,3,"In 1869, Ulysses S. Grant was sworn into the Presidency and the last stake was driven into the transcontinental railroad. That same year, two men--a fruit merchant named Joseph Campbell and an icebox manufacturer named Abraham Anderson &#x97; shook hands in Camden, New Jersey, to form a business that would one day become one of the most recognized in the world and serve as a symbol of Americana: Campbell Soup Company. Originally called the Joseph A. Campbell Preserve Company, the business produced canned tomatoes, vegetables, jellies, soups, condiments, and minced meats. In 1897, a major milestone occurred when Arthur Dorrance, the general manager of the company, reluctantly hired his 24-year-old nephew to join the company. Dr. John T. Dorrance, a chemist who had trained in Europe, was so determined to join Campbell that he agreed to pay for laboratory equipment out of his own pocket and accept a token salary of just $7.50 per week.Dr. Dorrance quickly made his mark on history with the invention of condensed soup in 1897. By eliminating the water in canned soup, he lowered the costs for packaging, shipping, and storage. This made it possible to offer a 10-ounce can of Campbell&#x92;s condensed soup for a dime, versus more than 30 cents for a typical 32-ounce can of soup. The idea became so hot with Americans that in 1922, the company formally adopted ""Soup"" as its middle name.Some of the most popular varieties of Campbell&#x92;s Soups have been enjoyed by generations of soup lovers: Tomato was introduced in 1897, while Cream of Mushroom and Chicken Noodle first appeared in 1934. Combined, Americans consume approximately 2.5 billion bowls of these three soups alone each year. Beyond these, Campbell markets almost every type of soup imaginable, from ""Chunky"" to ""Home Cookin&#x92;"" to ""Simply Home"" Ready-to-Serve Soups.The number of brand names under the Campbell banner has also grown, and now includes such well-known products as Pepperidge Farm breads, cookies, and crackers, Franco-American gravies and pastas, V8 vegetable juices, Swanson broths, and Godiva Chocolates.Today, the Campbell name stretches to China, Australia, Argentina, and beyond. Campbell products are available in practically every country in the world. While many of the products Americans know are offered internationally, regional varieties like Watercress and Duck-Gizzard Soup in China and a Cream of Chili Poblano soup in Mexico, have been introduced to respond to cultural differences. Even though the company&#x92;s foods have found their way into homes thousands of miles from the Camden, New Jersey headquarters, they still bear the name of the man who made his mark selling soup from a horse-drawn wagon--Joseph Campbell.","Campbell's Vegetable Beef Soup on the Go, 10.75 Ounce Microwavable Cups (Pack of 8)",16.05

Little did he know that the small business he began in 1906 would grow into the world's grandest nut company.Planters ad, 1949Obici, along with his friend and business partner Mario Peruzzi, founded Planters Peanut Company in Wilkes-Barre, Penn., in 1906. Seven years later, Obici built his first processing plant in Suffolk, Virginia. Mr. Peanut didn't come along until 1916, when a schoolboy named Antonio Gentile submitted his sketch to win a Planters contest for a brand icon. A commercial artist later added a top hat, monocle, and cane. The company's first ad, appearing in the Saturday Evening Post in 1918, was also the first for a salted nut. The hugely popular dry-roasted version of Planters peanuts made its debut in 1962. Later introductions have included unsalted and roasted peanuts, Planters Trail Mix, Honey-Roasted Peanuts and Cashew Mix, and more recently, NUTrition. For more than 100 years, Planters has built a reputation and a powerful brand by offering superior quality and product innovation.Planters is a member of the Kraft family of brands.About KraftKraft has come a long way since 29-year-old James L. Kraft moved from Ontario, canada, to Chicago and started selling cheese to grocers from a horse-drawn wagon. In fact, the story dates back further, since for more than 200 years, many companies have united to make Kraft Foods what it is today. It started before the Revolution--in Dorchester, Massachusetts--when, in 1765, a local physician, Dr. James Baker, went into partnership with a young Irish chocolate-maker, John Hannon. It was America's first chocolate mill, where, in 1780, they made a blend of quality chocolate called Baker's chocolate. Baker's chocolate was the first of a long list of companies that have joined Kraft Foods, Inc., in making good food for busy families.In 1988, Kraft became part of Philip Morris Companies Inc., and a year later Philip Morris Companies combined Kraft and General Foods Corp. to form Kraft General Foods, the largest food company in the U.S. Some of the most popular and well-known brands in the Kraft family include Maxwell House, Yuban, Oscar Mayer, Breakstone, Grape-Nuts, Jell-O, Post, Minute Rice, Cheez Whiz, Cracker Barrell, Tang, Cool Whip, Shake 'N Bake, Stove Top, General Foods International Coffees, and many, many more.","Planters Cashews in Milk Chocolate, 3.5-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12)",0.0

The Austrian-born Puck began his formal training at age 14, inspired by his mother, Maria, a hotel chef.

After spending two years as chef at the restaurant La Tour in Indianapolis, Puck moved to Los Angeles and became both chef and part owner of Ma Maison, which quickly became a magnet for the rich and famous.After the 1981 publication of his first cookbook,Modern French Cooking for the American Kitchen, based on his popular recipes at Ma Maison, Spago, located in West Hollywood on the Sunset Strip, was an instant success and culinary phenomenon from its opening day in 1982. His first signature dishes--such as ""gourmet"" pizzas topped with smoked salmon and caviar and Sonoma baby lamb with braised greens and rosemary--put him and Spago on the Los Angeles foodie map. Over its popular 18 years, the original location of Spago earned many accolades, including the prestigious Restaurant of the Year award by the James Beard Foundation in 1994.Over a span of 20 years, an empire of Wolfgang Puck dining establishments has opened, including fine dining restaurants in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Las Vegas, Palo Alto, and Maui and casual dining and quick service restaurants in nationwide urban centers, airports, and supermarkets.

Conscientious of the impact of our actions, we aspire to be environmentally responsible and globally sustainable by using recyclable and biodegradable packaging and sustainable bamboo in our merchandising.The Numi JourneyIn the fall of 1999, brother and sister Ahmed and Reem had a vision-to revive the serenity, creativity, and comfort that is inspired by the simple art of tea. Both artistic souls and world explorers, the two siblings have combined their belief in the transcendental properties of tea with their individual passions for photography, art, and culture. The result of this blend was Numi Tea, a refreshing and innovative selection of teas and teasans that awaken the palate, inspire the soul, and gracefully enhance water's unique potential.The brother and sister duo behind Numi TeaAhmed, the master alchemist behind Numi's blends, discovered the calming simplicity of tea and herbal teasans while living in Prague, Czech Republic, where he co-owned and ran two teahouses. A distinguished photographer, Ahmed used his artistic and intuitive nature as a foundation for his innovative and artisan approach to the blending of teas.Fluent in English, Arabic, French, German and Czech, Ahmed is a citizen of the world; each pot of Numi tea is an amalgamation of his worldly cultural knowledge, his in-depth understanding of teas, and his appreciation for quality.Ahmed's sister Reem has a background that is almost as diverse as the selection of Numi teas. Before the advent of Numi, Reem, a biomedical engineer, moved to Italy to nurture her artistic aspirations. Reem has exhibited her artwork around the world in San Francisco, New York City, Melbourne, and Florence. But you don't need to be a globetrotter to admire her artwork--Reem's original paintings are also exhibited on each one of Numi's packages. Inspired by her brother's photos and by the meditative nature and timeless essence of tea, Reem painted Numi's artwork using oil on small tin plates, with imagery that evokes a slower, more contemplative way of being. Reem believes that tea, like art, has a universal essence and is a portal for self-reflection.What started as a dream in Reem's small Oakland apartment moved to a lovely 25,000 squrare-foot space on the Oakland waterfront and has progressed into an exciting and delicious journey. Since its beginning, Numi has carved a distinct path in the U.S. tea world by introducing exotic teas such as Rooibos (Red Tea), Lemon Myrtle, Honeybush, and Dry Desert Lime, and also by offering full-leaf tea in teabags, without added oils or flavorings.

51,51,"The Puroast story begins while I&#x2019;m sitting on a Venezuelan coffee farm one morning and I&#x2019;m served a cup of coffee by my host. The same fellow who grew, roasted and brewed the beans. The taste was unlike any coffee I had ever had. Savory, rich and very smooth. No bitterness. I assumed this great taste was because I was on a coffee farm, like drinking wine in a vineyard. It turns out the secret to this flavor was how heat was used in roasting. I knew then that I wanted to learn how to create a coffee that is pure to the art of roasting. Puroast Coffee. After a long journey, we found the right flavor and Puroast Coffee was born. So my brother and I start selling Puroast in local stores in California, people loved the taste and then we find out there&#x2019;s a lot more to the story. Mixed in with the compliments about taste, we received comments telling us Puroast Coffee didn&#x2019;t upset customers&#x2019; stomachs or aggravate their heartburn. There were so many of these comments that we decided to find out if there was something different about Puroast which would be a significant benefit. We discovered there was a big difference in Puroast. Not only does our roasting recipe make for a smoother taste, it also greatly reduces the acid in the coffee by more than 70% compared to leading brands. 70% less acid than other coffees! This isn&#x2019;t just me saying this, it&#x2019;s Dr. Shibamoto and scientific research team from the University of California/Davis. Dr. Shibamoto found that in reducing acid levels, our roasting process dramatically increased the amount of antioxidants. And by dramatic I mean by 5 times more than other leading coffees and 7 times more than green tea. 7 times more antioxidants than green tea! You will discover what I did on that Venezuelan coffee farm, along with Puroast Coffee&#x2019;s exquisite flavor, the benefits of lower acid and rich levels of antioxidants will bring you enjoyment like no other coffee you&#x2019;ve ever had.","Puroast Low Acid Coffee Dark French Roast  Ground, 12 oz.

A high carbohydrate diet ensures that muscles and liver are full of glycogen and ready to fuel activity.Gatorade Carbohydrate Energy Formula provides an easy and convenient way to consume carbohydrates before exercise:The 79 grams of carbohydrates provides an easily digested, quick energy source for contracting muscles and can help top-off glycogen storesThe vitamin and mineral content is a blend of important cofactors for muscle carbohydrate metabolismWhen to Consume:Gatorade Carbohydrate Energy Formula should be consumed one to two hours prior to training or competition to ensure carbohydrate stores are topped off for optimal performance.Frequently Asked QuestionsQ: When should I use Gatorade Carbohydrate Energy Formula?A: Carbohydrate is the primary fuel for muscle during competition and training, and depletion of body carbohydrate predisposes athletes to acute and chronic fatigue. Drink one bottle of Gatorade Carbohydrate Energy Formula one to two hours prior to a training session or competition to ensure muscle and liver glycogen stores are topped off.Q: Is the Gatorade Carbohydrate Energy Formula similar to so-called ""energy drinks""?A: Even though Gatorade Carbohydrate Energy Formula has the carbohydrate sources necessary to fuel working muscles, it should not be confused with energy drinks that use caffeine. Those drinks provide a combination of perceived energy or ""buzz"" from caffeine along with carbohydrates. Many of these energy drinks also contain ingredients such as guarana, ginseng, and taurine, or herbs that have unproven performance benefit for athletes.In addition to 79 grams of carbohydrates, the Gatorade Carbohydrate Energy contains an array of vitamins and minerals, which is a blend of important co-factors for muscle carbohydrate metabolism.Q: Why doesn't Gatorade Carbohydrate Energy Formula contain caffeine?A: Caffeine provides athletes with perceived energy but not calories for real energy.

We are grateful to those who contribute to our tea journey, and we hope to have a positive impact on all members of our ""Communitea""--from farmer to packer to our fellow tea drinker. Conscientious of the impact of our actions, we aspire to be environmentally responsible and globally sustainable by using recyclable and biodegradable packaging and sustainable bamboo in our merchandising.The Numi JourneyIn the fall of 1999, brother and sister Ahmed and Reem had a vision-to revive the serenity, creativity, and comfort that is inspired by the simple art of tea. Both artistic souls and world explorers, the two siblings have combined their belief in the transcendental properties of tea with their individual passions for photography, art, and culture. The result of this blend was Numi Tea, a refreshing and innovative selection of teas and teasans that awaken the palate, inspire the soul, and gracefully enhance water's unique potential.Ahmed, the master alchemist behind Numi's blends, discovered the calming simplicity of tea and herbal teasans while living in Prague, Czech Republic, where he co-owned and ran two teahouses. A distinguished photographer, Ahmed used his artistic and intuitive nature as a foundation for his innovative and artisan approach to the blending of teas.Fluent in English, Arabic, French, German and Czech, Ahmed is a citizen of the world; each pot of Numi tea is an amalgamation of his worldly cultural knowledge, his in-depth understanding of teas, and his appreciation for quality.Ahmed's sister Reem has a background that is almost as diverse as the selection of Numi teas. Before the advent of Numi, Reem, a biomedical engineer, moved to Italy to nurture her artistic aspirations. Reem has exhibited her artwork around the world in San Francisco, New York City, Melbourne, and Florence. But you don't need to be a globetrotter to admire her artwork--Reem's original paintings are also exhibited on each one of Numi's packages. Inspired by her brother's photos and by the meditative nature and timeless essence of tea, Reem painted Numi's artwork using oil on small tin plates, with imagery that evokes a slower, more contemplative way of being. Reem believes that tea, like art, has a universal essence and is a portal for self-reflection.What started as a dream in Reem's small Oakland apartment moved to a lovely 25,000 squrare-foot space on the Oakland waterfront and has progressed into an exciting and delicious journey. Since its beginning, Numi has carved a distinct path in the U.S. tea world by introducing exotic teas such as Rooibos (Red Tea), Lemon Myrtle, Honeybush, and Dry Desert Lime, and also by offering full-leaf tea in teabags, without added oils or flavorings. Numi continues to pave the way and set new tea trends, most recently with the launch of the first line of Organic Puerh Tea in bags and bottles!","Numi Organic Tea Magnolia Puerh, Full Leaf Green Tea, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 2)",0.0

Starting in 1975, the company broadened its focus to include bagged teas and then began to sell a full line of traditional, specialty blend and herbal teas directly to fine restaurants and through a mail order catalog to consumers. Today, Stash Tea Company is one of the largest specialty tea companies in the United States. The company derives its name from an entertaining aspect of tea folklore. In earlier centuries, tea was a valuable commodity traditionally transported by clipper ship. The ship&#x2019;s captain often was presented with some of the finest teas for his personal use.

Italian Roast is the kind of coffee you'll find if you're lucky enough to get to Southern Italy. Full-bodied and intense, it has a subtle spiciness and a long, satisfying finish. Made with 100% Arabica coffee.ABOUT TULLY'S:Some professionals need to approach their jobs slowly and with a great deal of care.  Like tightrope walkers.  Or brain surgeons.  Or tattoo artists. At Tully&#x2019;s, the same holds true for creating great coffee.  It takes a lot of time and patience, which is why we slow roast our coffee beans to gently coax out the complex flavors and aromas. With roots in the Pacific Northwest, where coffee is a way of life, we take our time in roasting and in training each master roaster in our artisanal approach. From the aroma to the full-bodied flavor, you can taste the time taken in every satisfying cup of Tully&#x2019;s coffee.  Now we invite you to take your time discovering it.INGREDIENTS:ARABICA COFFEEPACKAGING CHANGE:In the next few months you may notice a change to the K-Cup pack lids.

This mineral-rich sweetener is the perfect way to satisfy your sweet tooth with no guilty consequence.Organic Coconut Sugar: A Healthy Sugar AlternativeLow-Glycemic:Coconut Sugar is a low-glycemic sweetener that has been shown to support healthy blood sugar balance. A study published by the Food and Nutrition Research Institute compared the glycemic indexes of both coconut sugar and table sugar on a scale of 100, indicating a value of 35 and 60, respectively. Viva Labs Organic Coconut Sugar is a one-to-one ratio with table sugar, helping you to achieve the same sweetness without the corresponding sugar spike.Nutrient-Dense:Because coconut sugar is unrefined, it maintains essential nutrients like calcium, potassium, iron and zinc. A study published by the Food and Nutrition Research Institute indicated that coconut sugar had roughly double of the amount of iron compared to ordinary table sugar in a 100g serving. One tablespoon of Viva Labs Organic Coconut Sugar represents 10% of your daily iron intake, based on a 2,000 calorie diet.The Viva Labs DifferenceTo produce Viva Labs' Organic Coconut Sugar, local farmers ""tap"" the delicate, unopened flowers of coconut palm trees, oozing with sweet coconut nectar.
